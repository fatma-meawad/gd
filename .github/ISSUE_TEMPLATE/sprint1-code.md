### Implement the logic

- [ ] Move your issue to `in progress`. Add all attributes as well. Then create another branch.

- [ ] Consider the **openapi contract** is frozen now. Don't make any changes to it.

- [ ] Write only the code that you need to get your tests (written or modified in phase 1) **pass**. 

### Cleaning your code

- [ ] lint your code and clean up as you go. Use `npm run lint`. Don't worry about cleaning test code, just main logic.

- [ ] If you need something from others and there is a dependency, try to mock it till a couple of days before the final deadline. However, you should aim to have all your work integrated. 

- [ ] The pull request review in the second phase requires code review.
    1.  no redudant code
    1.  linting is done
    1.  no schema validation code
    1.  Squads are not directly importing each other's work (across folders' imports)


- [ ]  When ready, move your issue to review and  create a pull request of your work.
